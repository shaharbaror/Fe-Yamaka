# Fe-Yamaka = Kipat Barzel = Iron Dome
this is the school cyber project were I am making a "clone" of Iron Dome in real life.
I have a map on the ground with a couple of cameras and a ball (currently red ball).
the cameras will detect the ball and calculate its path as a function, after that they will send the function to a ball launcher to take down the opposing ball, while alerting the residents on the part the ball is supposed to hit.
Currently this is not a finished product.
